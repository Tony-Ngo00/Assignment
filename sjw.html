                    Summary
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Sung Jinwoo is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank
                    Hunter, he got
                    the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique
                    ability to grow
                    in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him
                    by the
                    System, Sung Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow
                    Monarch.

                    Personality
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Jinwoo is a confident individual with a strong sense of family and a thirst for power. As
                    a result, he is very close to his sister, mother, and Jinho, and rarely wastes an opportunity to
                    grow stronger.

                <p class="p1">
                    Appearance
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Back when he first awakened, Jinwoo was a short, scrawny young man with hair long enough
                    to
                    completely cover his ears. His face was also very boyish, which made him look even younger than his
                    sister Jinah, and he tended to dress in a simple blue hoodie and jeans. After his second awakening,
                    Jinwoo became a handsome and muscular young man with gray eyes, black hair, and sharp facial
                    features. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is almost always seen
                    wearing dark colors, particularly black.
