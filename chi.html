                    Personality
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Cha is very meticulous and cares about the lives of those around her, as demonstrated
                    by how she developed a habit of patrolling the boss' lair during her guild's raids in order to
                    ensure the safety of the mining and hauling teams. She is also very diligent when training, as she
                    continued to hone her sword technique even after becoming a S-Rank Hunter.

                    Appearance
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Cha Hae In is a pretty young woman with gray eyes and blonde hair in a bob cut. She
                    typically
                    wears red-themed armor on raids and carries a black sword with a silver hilt. When using her
                    abilities, her eyes glow yellow.

                    Powers and Abilities
                </p>
                <p class="p2">
                    Mana Smell: Cha is sensitive to the smell of mana, causing hunters and monsters to smell foul to
                    her. Jinwoo is the only known hunter who does not smell bad to her, due to his status as the Player
                    of the System.
                    <br><br>
                    Master Swordsman: Cha is proficient at swordsmanship and is able to come up with creative and
                    unorthodox ways to kill monsters efficiently. As a testament to her sword-fighting skills, she was
                    able to easily defeat Igris during their sparring session.
                    <br><br>
                    Enhanced Strength: Cha possesses great strength. She was able to easily defeat Igris in their
                    sparring match, hit Kumamoto in the face with enough force to make him bleed, and decapitate the Ant
                    Queen with one swing of her sword.
                    <br><br>
                    Enhanced Speed: Cha is able to move at great speeds and is well-known amongst the Korean hunting
                    community for just how fast she is in battle. She was also able to easily dodge Igris' attacks,
                    pummel Kumamoto before he could even react, overwhelm Kanae with her movements, and even dodge some
                    of Beru's attacks during their sparring match.
                    <br><br>
                    Enhanced Durability: Cha possesses a great deal of durability. As a testament to this, she was able
                    to stay alive for a significant amount of time after the Ant King injured her and
                    continue moving at top speed after the Architect cut clean through her shoulder.
                    <br><br>
                    Sword Dance: Cha significantly increases her attack speed, giving her dance-like movements.
                    <br><br>
                    Sword of Light: Cha transforms her sword into pure light, significantly increasing her cutting power.
                    <br><br>
                    Quake of Provocation: Cha stabs her sword into the ground, creating a small earthquake that damages any enemies caught in its radius.
