                    Personality
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Ashborn cared greatly about life and had a benevolent attitude towards humanity. He also
                    had a profound desire for peace and was tired of the endless war between the Monarchs and the
                    Rulers, leading him to eventually entrust both his ambitions and his powers to a human in hopes of
                    putting an end to the bloodshed once and for all. At the same time, however, he was blindly loyal to
                    the Absolute Being and continued to fight on the latter's behalf even after learning the truth
                    behind his existence.

                <p class="p1">
                    Appearance
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Ashborn was a huge, muscular shadow with glowing flame-like purple hair, glowing purple
                    eyes, two curved black horns, and sharp claws. He also wore jet-black armor and a long smoky black
                    cloak, and wielded a pure black sword.
                    As a Ruler, Ashborn was a burly white knight with large white wings, long silver hair, and glowing
                    white eyes. He also wore silver robes with light tan armor and a grayish-blue cloak, and wielded a
                    white sword with a light tan guard and a gray hilt.

                    Immense Strength: As the strongest Ruler, Ashborn possessed incomparably immense levels of physical
                    strength. As a testament to this, he was able to brutally overpower two Monarchs at once and pop
                    Baran's skull like a grape with one hand.

                    <br><br>
                    Shadow Preservation: Ashborn was able to preserve his shadows in storage and monitor them by perceiving their senses.

                    Monarch's Domain: Ashborn was able to buff the strength of all of his active shadows by 50% in battle.
